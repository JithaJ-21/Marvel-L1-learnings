A ***client*** is a program or device that sends requests to a server for any information or services and the ***server***, which is also a program or device, in turn responds to the requests, thereby enabling communication and resource sharing on a network.
  ***Socket.IO*** allows this bi-directional communication between client and server. Bi-directional communications are enabled when the client has Socket.IO in the browser, and the server has also integrated the Socket.IO package. 
  **JSON** is the simplest form in which data can be sent.
